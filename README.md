## What is Textream?

Textream is a macOS app that listens to your voice and highlights your script in real-time. It displays your text in a sleek **Dynamic Island-style overlay** at the top of your screen — visible only to you, invisible to your audience.

Paste your script, hit play, and start speaking. Words light up as you say them. When you're done, the overlay closes automatically.

## Download

**[Download the latest .dmg from Releases](https://github.com/f/textream/releases/latest)**

> Requires **macOS 14 Sonoma** or later. Works on Apple Silicon and Intel.

### First launch

Since Textream is distributed outside the Mac App Store, macOS may block it on first open. Run this once in Terminal:

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/Textream.app
```

Then right-click the app → **Open**. After the first launch, macOS remembers your choice.

## Features

- **Real-time voice tracking** — On-device speech recognition highlights words as you say them. No cloud, no latency, works offline.
- **Dynamic Island overlay** — A notch-shaped floating overlay at the top of your screen, inspired by the MacBook Dynamic Island. Sits above all apps.
- **Live waveform** — Visual voice activity indicator so you always know the mic is picking you up.
- **Tap to jump** — Tap any word in the overlay to jump the tracker to that position.
- **Pause & resume** — Go off-script, take a break, come back. The tracker picks up where you left off.
- **Adjustable size** — Resize the overlay width and text height from Settings (⌘,) to fit your screen.
- **Completely private** — All processing happens on-device. No accounts, no tracking, no data leaves your Mac.

## Who it's for

| Use case | How Textream helps |
|---|---|
| **Streamers** | Read sponsor segments, announcements, and talking points without looking away from the camera. |
| **Interviewers** | Keep your questions visible while maintaining natural eye contact with your guest. |
| **Presenters** | Deliver keynotes, demos, and talks with confidence. Never lose your place. |
| **Podcasters** | Follow show notes, ad reads, and topic outlines hands-free while recording. |

## How It Works

1. **Paste your script** — Drop your talking points, interview questions, or full script into the text editor.
2. **Hit play** — The Dynamic Island overlay slides down from the top of your screen.
3. **Start speaking** — Words highlight in real-time as you read. When you finish, the overlay closes automatically.

## Building from Source

### Requirements

- macOS 14+
- Xcode 16+
- Swift 5.0+

### Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/f/textream.git
cd textream/Textream
open Textream.xcodeproj
```

Build and run with ⌘R in Xcode.

### Project structure

```

├── Info.plist
└── Textream/
    ├── TextreamApp.swift          # App entry point, deep link handling

    ├── SettingsView.swift         # Notch size settings
    └── Assets.xcassets/           # App icon and colors
```

## URL Scheme

Textream supports the `textream://` URL scheme for launching directly into the overlay:

```
textream://start?text=Hello%20world
```

It also registers as a macOS Service, so you can select text in any app and send it to Textream via the Services menu.
